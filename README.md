# Sales-Dashboard
I created a Sales Dashboard in Power BI based on guided project provided by 'Data Tutorials' YouTube channel. [Link to the Youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGTSPIUwBnI)
Through this project, I learned several useful DAX formulas and explored the Parameter feature for the first time. The report is well-structured, visually appealing, and provides a wealth of insightsâ€”all within a single page.
